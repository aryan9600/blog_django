# Blog_Django



This is a blog app built using Django :snake:. I have kept in mind the **best practices** while building this Django application. Some of its features include:

  - Sharing blog posts via mail :email:
  - Posting comments on blog posts :pencil2:
  - Related posts recommendations :iphone:
  - PostgreSQL :rocket:
  - Full search functionality with ranking :computer:
  - Sitemapping :hourglass:
